# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber, who designed it to be easily readable and easy to write.

Markdown is used for formatting text in a variety of contexts, including online forums, blog posts, and readme files. It is a simple way to add formatting to text, such as headings, bold and italic text, lists, and links.

One of the main benefits of Markdown is that it is very easy to learn. There are only a few basic syntax rules to remember, and once you have learned them, you can quickly format text with minimal effort.

* Here are some of the basic syntax rules for Markdown:

* Headings are denoted by `#` at the beginning of a line. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading, with one `#` being a top-level heading and six `#` symbols indicating a heading of lowest level.

* Bold text is denoted by surrounding a word or phrase with `**` (two asterisks).

* Italic text is denoted by surrounding a word or phrase with `_` (one underscore).

* Links are denoted by surrounding the linked text with `[ ]` and including the link URL immediately after, like so: `[Link Text](http://link-url.com)`.

* Lists are created by starting a line with a `*` (asterisk) for an unordered list or a `1.` for an ordered list.

Overall, Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language that can help you format text quickly and effectively. Whether you are writing a blog post, creating a readme file, or simply want to add some formatting to a message on an online forum, Markdown is a great choice.
